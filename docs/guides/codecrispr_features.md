# CodeCRISPR Features Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of **all features currently supported by CodeCRISPR**, with an emphasis on how they may be used by either a human user or an AI agent via the MCP interface.

---

## Core Capabilities

### Reference Mapping
- CodeCRISPR builds a reference map that identifies the **location of functions, methods, blocks, or sections** in supported file types.
- The map is used to quickly locate, replace, or preview a named code block.
- This reference map is specific to the language of the file and is updated after each modification.

### Block Replacement
- Users or AI can issue a request to **replace a named function or block** with new content.
- CodeCRISPR performs a structural replacement without modifying unrelated parts of the file.
- Replacements update the reference map in-memory without requiring a re-parse of the entire file.

### Diff Output
- Each replacement operation generates a **Git-style unified diff** that highlights:
  - Removed lines (`-`)
  - Added lines (`+`)
  - Context lines (unchanged)
- This output helps users and AI verify the exact impact of changes without printing the entire file.
- Diffs include:
  - Original and modified file labels
  - A "hunk" header showing line numbers and method name
  - Line-level changes

### Section Preview
- Users or AI agents can request to preview the **current contents of any named method or section** before deciding whether to modify it.
- This preview uses the reference map to extract only the relevant lines from the file.
- The command `--inspect --preview "method_name"` displays the code for that block only.

---

## Performance Characteristics

- **Initial parse** is O(n) where n is the number of lines.
- **Subsequent operations** (e.g., replacement, preview) are constant time (O(1)) thanks to the reference map.
- **Edits are performed in memory**, with disk writes only when explicitly saved.
- **Incremental map updates** allow efficient management of large files, up to tens of thousands of lines.

---

## File Types and Parsers

Each supported file type has a dedicated parsing strategy:
- Python: Indentation-based
- JavaScript / TypeScript / Java / Go / Rust / C++ / Julia / Swift / R: Pattern-based
- CSS / Shell / SPSS: Block-based
- HTML / XML / SVG: Tag-based
- LaTeX: Environment-based (`\begin{...}`/`\end{...}`)
- Markdown: Heading-based
- JSON: Named-key-based
- SQL: Pattern-based statement parsing

---

## Backup System

- If `backup_enabled = true`, CodeCRISPR creates `.bak` files before modification.
- Subsequent backups are numbered (`.bak`, `.bak1`, `.bak2`, ...) to avoid overwrites.
- This ensures recovery is always possible even in batch or iterative edit scenarios.

---

## Token Efficiency

- CodeCRISPR minimizes token usage by operating only on relevant sections.
- It avoids full-file reads/writes unless explicitly instructed.
- This results in 80â€“90% token savings in typical multi-edit workflows compared to naive AI editing.

## AI Integration Features

CodeCRISPR was designed with **AI-agent workflows** in mind:

- **Zero installation**: Runs with native Python on macOS (no extra packages required).
- **CLI-driven**: Accepts clean command-line invocations like `python3 codecrispr.py file.py "method" "new_code"`.
- **Inspectable interface**: AI can request the list of functions (`--inspect`) and preview specific ones.
- **Safe retry behavior**: If a change fails due to name mismatch, no file is altered.
- **Error messages**: Human-readable and designed for easy parsing by AI (e.g., `Function 'foo' not found`).

---

## Batch Operations

- CodeCRISPR supports JSON-based batch editing:
```json
{
  "updates": [
    { "method": "foo", "code": "..." },
    { "method": "bar", "code": "..." }
  ]
}
```
- This allows AI or users to edit many parts of a file efficiently in one invocation.

---

## Extensibility

- New tools can be created for additional languages by subclassing and implementing a parser for:
  - Reference mapping
  - Section identification
- Existing tools are modular and easy to adapt for adjacent file types or custom formats.

---

## Limitations

- Structural rather than semantic: does not parse ASTs or validate syntax
- Cannot infer edits without explicit replacement code
- Reference map depends on well-formed file structures (e.g., matching braces, consistent indentation)

---

## Summary

CodeCRISPR empowers human users and AI agents to work efficiently with large files, focusing on precise, token-efficient, targeted edits. It acts as a language-agnostic surgical editor that integrates smoothly into Claude workflows through MCP or direct local CLI use.
